This is my version of the Library project for The Odin Project.

<a href="https://thatblindgeye.github.io/Library/" target="_blank">Live Demo of my Library.</a>

<b>FEATURES</b>
A tag system for books that you add, allowing you to mark your favorite books, books you plan to reread later, or books that you disliked.

Choose between the default dark theme and a light theme to save your eyes some strain.

Filter the books that are displayed by their read status, or sort how the books are displayed by the date added, book title, and author.

<b>HOW TO USE</b>
Books that you enter on this site are stored in two places: the library, which is a behind-the-scenes collection of all of your books, and the bookshelf, the physical display of your books that you will see.

<b>Adding/Updating a Book</b>
After clicking the "New Book" button, a modal will popup for you to enter the book information. The only field that is required is the book title, and by default books will be added as "unread" if the checkbox is left unchecked. After entering all the information you want, click the "Add" button to add the book to your library and display it on your bookshelf.

If you click the pencil icon on a book in your bookshelf, it will open the same modal as when you added it, except it will now allow you to update any fields for that book, and clicking the "Update" button will submit those changes to your library and bookshelf.

When adding tags for a book, be sure to separate each tag with a comma. If you want to mark a book as your favorite and the name of the book series, you would enter "favorite, song of ice and fire". Now the next time you filter your bookshelf, you can easily bring up all the books in the Game of Thrones series without having to make the book titles too long, i.e. "A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones".

If you decide you don't want to add or update a book, just click the X icon or anywhere outside the modal to close it.

<b>Filtering The Bookshelf</b>
Filtering your bookshelf is easy! When you want to filter by title or author, just enter the title or author you're looking for. This can be handy if your bookshelf has gotten fairly large and you can't remember whether you've already added a book to it.

Just like when adding tags to a book, you must separate the tags. However, when filtering your bookshelf by tags, you can either separate them with a comma (,) or a plus sign (+).

When you separate tags with a comma, the filter will look through each book to see if at least one tag is present. "Favorite, Lord of the Rings" will display all books that have a tag of favorite entered on it OR a tag of Lord of the Rings on it. So you will end up with all of your Lord of the Rings books showing up, but you will also get any non-Lord of the Rings books that were tagged as a favorite.

When you separate tags with a plus sign, the filter will look through each book to see if every tag is present. "Never read+favorite+ten out of ten+horrible" would most likely return zero results, unless you have a very specific tagging system.
