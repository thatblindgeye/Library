This is my version of the Library project for The Odin Project.

<a href="">Live Demo of my Library.</a>

Goals:

1. OPTIONAL - Allow user to filter their library via search bar, or via dropdown.
2. Create individual cards for books that include title (required), author (optional), total pages/read pages (optional), and dropdown to select whether the book has been read/unread (required).
3. Add storage capability to save library and settings when leaving/returning to the page.

In Progress:

1. Finish HTML/CSS for mobile/small viewports

To Do:

1. Make CSS responsive for larger viewports, moving the book stats/header from the top to a left sidebar
2. Begin Javascript for adding books to library
